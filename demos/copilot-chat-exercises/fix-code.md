![cover](images/copilot-chat-cover-wide-2.png)

### :pencil2: Exercise 1: Use `Copilot Chat` to fix your code

- Open the  [`calculator-bug.js`](../sample-code/calculator-bug.js) file and ask **Copilot Chat** to 'improve' the code

    ```
    can you improve the structure and readability of the method that calculates the factorial
    ```

  - Sample

    (⚠️ Note: that Copilot Chat even refers to the request as **`refactor`**)

- Compare the "before & after" code

#### Some additional steps

1. Try this with larger code samples
  
2. Explore the option to highlight (select) a segement from the code and only refactor that

- **Note:** You can import the refactored code into the original code base
